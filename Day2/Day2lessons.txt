Lessons Learned:

I had a lot of trouble with multi-dimensional slice declaration. It shouldn't have taken me so long.

I initially got frustrated at having repetitive test code before i got to my final test code.
Early refactoring and optimisation cost me a lot of early time.

I was having issues with reference/value typing in Golang for Slices. I found storing the values from each
address in variables ended up a lot simpler and more readable than directly referencing the array.

Part 2 took me 2 minutes, evidently theres a better approach using memoization but im lazy.
